# backup-my-CF
A tool made to backup(save a copy in local disk) all of your succesfully submitted codes on codeforces :)

## Features

* Ask for username(Handle or Email) of the codeforces account whose codes you want.(handle is case insensetive)
* All of your succesfully submitted codes get downloaded in the folder named same as handle name.
* All the codes are named according the contest number and level. eg:-111E ,103A etc.
* Running the script next time would download only new codes.
* You can push these codes on your GitHub to show your swag. ;)
